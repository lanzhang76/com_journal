* retrieve and swap
* part-of-speech tag - replaces alternative word
* Wordnet path similarity, POS tags
* synset: a set of synonyms that share a common meaning.
* hypernyms and hyponym

> hypernyms - the word that has broader meaning and more specific words underneath <br>
hyponym - the more specific word <br>
.closure(lambda s:s.hypernyms()) vs .closure(lambda s:s.hyponyms())

* r"\." - raw text literal search
* \. matches with every character except a new line
* \d matches digital numbers  \D matches everything not a digit \d{3} means 3 of digits

example1: capture the phone number
```
text = '''
324.235.153
'''
pattern = re.compile(r'\d{3}.\d{3}.\d{4}')
matches = pattern.finditer(text)
for match in matches:
	print(match)
```
example2: capture all the urls
```
urls = '''
https://www.google.com
http://coe.com
https://youtube.com
https://www.nasa.gov
pattern = re.compile(r'https?://(www\.)?\w+\.\w'+)
```

* + \.(com|edu|net) or
* match.group(1) accessing references in expressions 
* substitution: outputs urls only with group 2 and 3 aka without "wwww."
```
sub = pattern.sub(r'\2\3',urls, re.IGNORECASE)
```
```
sub = pattern.findall(r'\2\3',urls)
```
